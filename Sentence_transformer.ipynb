    "### Code Flow and Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries**:\n",
    "   - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation and numerical operations.\n",
    "   - `fuzzywuzzy` for fuzzy string matching.\n",
    "   - `SentenceTransformer` from `sentence_transformers` for generating sentence embeddings.\n",
    "   - `PCA` from `sklearn.decomposition` for dimensionality reduction (optional, not used here).\n",
    "   - `DistanceMetric` from `sklearn.metrics` for computing pairwise distances between embeddings.\n",
    "   - `SpellChecker` for correcting spelling errors in the user query.\n",
    "   - `re` for regular expression matching.\n",
    "   - `matplotlib` for plotting (optional, not used here).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load and Prepare Data**:\n",
    "   - Load event data from `Event_date.xlsx`.\n",
    "   - Combine relevant columns (`Location`, `Primary Category`, `Sub Category`, `Event Names`, `Description`) into a single column `Combined` for further analysis.\n",
    "   - This combined column serves as the input for text-based similarity searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Query Handling and Correction**:\n",
    "   - The `correct_query()` function processes the user query:\n",
    "     - It corrects misspelled words using the `SpellChecker` and handles multi-word matches using `fuzzywuzzy`.\n",
    "     - It compares the query tokens to known locations (from the dataset) to provide context-specific corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Date Range Parsing**:\n",
    "   - The `get_date_range()` function extracts a date range based on specific keywords (e.g., \"today\", \"this weekend\", \"next month\").\n",
    "   - This allows filtering the events by date based on the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Event Filtering by Date**:\n",
    "   - The `filter_events()` function filters events from the dataset that occur within the identified date range, extracted from the query.\n",
    "   - This step limits the scope of the search to relevant events based on time constraints in the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Text Embedding Using SentenceTransformer**:\n",
    "   - A pre-trained model, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from **SentenceTransformer**, is used to convert event descriptions and the user query into dense numerical vectors (embeddings).\n",
    "   - The embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the event descriptions and user query for similarity analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Distance Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The `DistanceMetric.get_metric('euclidean')` computes the Euclidean distance between the query embedding and the event description embeddings.\n",
    "   - Events are sorted by proximity to the query embedding, with closer (more relevant) events ranked higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Result Sorting and Output**:\n",
    "   - The events are sorted by their distance from the user query, with the most relevant events displayed at the top of the list.\n",
    "   - The resulting dataframe contains the most relevant events based on both semantic similarity and date filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Usage:\n",
    "- The user enters a query, for example: `\"concert near shiva nagar this weekend\"`.\n",
    "- The system corrects the query, extracts the relevant date range (e.g., \"this weekend\"), and filters events that match both the date and semantic content of the query.\n",
    "- Finally, it ranks the events based on semantic similarity using SentenceTransformer embeddings.\n",
